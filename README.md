This is a simple Python script that contains functions for CRUD operations on SQLite.

---

To run this, open your terminal or command prompt and go to the directory where your cloned repository is located:

```shell
$ cd go/to/path
```

Execute the Python script:

```shell
$ python _python-sqlite.py
```

This should create an SQLite database named `db.db` with an `Employee` table that contains the following columns and rows:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>ID</th>
        <th>Fname</th>
        <th>Lname</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>ALYSSON</td>
        <td>ALVARAN</td>
    </tr>
</table>
